## 🎯 The Problem

**DSA is the gatekeeper to tech jobs** — yet students are struggling:

- **90%** of FAANG companies test DSA in interviews
- **65%** of students fail their first coding round  
- **40%** avoid DSA entirely due to complexity

**Why?** Abstract teaching, debugging frustration, and outdated tools.

## ✨ The Solution

**AlgoPlayground** transforms DSA learning through:

### 🎮 **3D Interactive Visualizations**
Real-time algorithm animations with Three.js + smooth controls

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Debugging**  
Submit code → Get intelligent fixes → Visualize both wrong & correct solutions

### 🎨 **Modern Experience**
Multi-language support (Java, C++, Python, JS) with beautiful UI

### 📚 **Smart Learning Paths**
Personalized roadmaps with integrated ChatBot assistance
