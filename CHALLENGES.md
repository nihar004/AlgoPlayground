## Challenge: Database Connection Timeout (2024-03-04)

### Problem

Experienced frequent database connection timeouts when processing large datasets in the user analytics module.

### Context

Using PostgreSQL with an ORM in a Python web application, handling user interaction logs.

### Root Cause

Inefficient connection pooling and lack of proper timeout configuration.

### Solution

- Implemented connection pooling using SQLAlchemy
- Adjusted connection timeout and max connection settings
- Added robust error handling and reconnection logic

### Lessons Learned

- Always configure database connection parameters carefully
- Use connection pooling for better performance
- Implement comprehensive error handling
